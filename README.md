# FlowUtils

## Introduction
This is a useful collection of functions that can be easily integrated into any project. Most of the utilities are header files only and just need to be included into your source code. 

## Dependencies
The code was written with C++ 17 in mind and some of the utilities have dependencies.

The dependencies are:
- boost
- rapidjson
- openssl

Not all are needed for every util.
